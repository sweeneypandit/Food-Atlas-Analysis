# Food-Atlas-Analysis
The factors that affect the food choices and health lifestyle of US
This dataset was picked up at the link below:
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/food-environment-atlas-f4a22
https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-environment-atlas/data-access-and-documentation-downloads/

To begin with this dataset is quite diverse.It has lot of data ranging from years 2008-2016. One problem I faced while working with 
this dataset was that I could not base my analysis on the different parameters that I wanted for specific years as they were not
consistently recorded for every year. Nevertheless, I picked by 2010,2015,2016 as my years for analysis.
In  Analysis 1 ,I focussed on year 2010 and the access parameters affecting the persistent poverty counties in 2010
In Analysis 2, I focussed on year 2015 and the access, food assistance parameters affecting the poverty rate in 2015
In Analysis 3, I focussed on year 2016 and the farmers market analysis across the states and counties in US.

I played around with R to gather different ways of implementing the same logical result.I hope you enjoy visiting it.
